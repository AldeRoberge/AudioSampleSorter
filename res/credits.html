<p>It is inspired by FL Studio's auto playing file browser and lack of sorting tools for large audio libraries.</p>
<p><br />Here are the awesome libraries and tools used to overcome development challenges :</p>
<p><br />Credits are generated by the awesome online HTML editor html-online.com/editor/</p>
<p>Property files is handled by the awesomely simple Commons-configuration library</p>
<p>jnativehook is used to listen for global key imputs</p>
<p>Sounds are played by the best in class Java audio player, from nonetheless than JavaLayer</p>
<p>And finally StackOverflow to support my lazy coding practices</p>
